// All this is about silencing the heat bed, as it behaves like a loudspeaker.
// Basically, we want the PWM heating switched at 30Hz (or so) which is a well ballanced
// frequency for both power supply units (i.e. both PSUs are reasonably silent).
// The only trouble is the rising or falling edge of bed heating - that creates an audible click.
// This audible click may be suppressed by making the rising or falling edge NOT sharp.
// Of course, making non-sharp edges in digital technology is not easy, but there is a solution.
// It is possible to do a fast PWM sequence with duty starting from 0 to 255.
// Doing this at higher frequency than the bed "loudspeaker" can handle makes the click barely audible.
// Technically:
// timer0 is set to fast PWM mode at 62.5kHz (timer0 is linked to the bed heating pin) (zero prescaler)
// To keep the bed switching at 30Hz - we don't want the PWM running at 62kHz all the time 
// since it would burn the heatbed's MOSFET:
// 16MHz/256 levels of PWM duty gives us 62.5kHz
// 62.5kHz/256 gives ~244Hz, that is still too fast - 244/8 gives ~30Hz, that's what we need
// So the automaton runs atop of inner 8 (or 16) cycles.
// The finite automaton is running in the ISR(TIMER0_OVF_vect)

// 2019-08-14 update: the original algorithm worked very well, however there were 2 regressions:
// 1. 62kHz ISR requires considerable amount of processing power, 
//    USB transfer speed dropped by 20%, which was most notable when doing short G-code segments.
// 2. Some users reported TLed PSU started clicking when running at 120V/60Hz. 
//    This looks like the original algorithm didn't maintain base PWM 30Hz, but only 15Hz
// To address both issues, there is an improved approach based on the idea of leveraging
// different CLK prescalers in some automaton states - i.e. when holding LOW or HIGH on the output pin,
// we don't have to clock 62kHz, but we can increase the CLK prescaler for these states to 8 (or even 64).
// That shall result in the ISR not being called that much resulting in regained performance
// Theoretically this is relatively easy, however one must be very carefull handling the AVR's timer
// control registers correctly, especially setting them in a correct order.
// Some registers are double buffered, some changes are applied in next cycles etc.
// The biggest problem was with the CLK prescaler itself - this circuit is shared among almost all timers,
// we don't want to reset the prescaler counted value when transiting among automaton states.
// Resetting the prescaler would make the PWM more precise, right now there are temporal segments
// of variable period ranging from 0 to 7 62kHz ticks - that's logical, the timer must "sync"
// to the new slower CLK after setting the slower prescaler value.
// In our application, this isn't any significant problem and may be ignored.
// Doing changes in timer's registers non-correctly results in artefacts on the output pin
// - it can toggle unnoticed, which will result in bed clicking again.
// That's why there are special transition states ZERO_TO_RISE and ONE_TO_FALL, which enable the
// counter change its operation atomically and without artefacts on the output pin.
// The resulting signal on the output pin was checked with an osciloscope. 
// If there are any change requirements in the future, the signal must be checked with an osciloscope again,
// ad-hoc changes may completely screw things up!

// 2020-01-29 update: we are introducing a new option to the automaton that will allow us to force the output state
// to either full ON or OFF. This is so that interference during the MBL probing is minimal.
// To accomplish this goal we use bedPWMDisabled. It is only supposed to be used for brief periods of time as to
// not make the bed temperature too unstable. Also, careful consideration should be used when using this
// option as leaving this enabled will also keep the bed output in the state it stopped in.
