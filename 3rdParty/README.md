These are some extra attributions for items that are not
clearly externally sourced standalone submodules or folders:
- Prusa OBJs and MTLs are based on jzkmath's STEP assembly: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3467092/files
- SD card simulation originally based on Philip Withnall's Brewing Logger: https://gitlab.com/brewing-logger/firmware (see file header for more info about modifications)
- gcovr is a hacked-up version of the official gcovr that excludes the 'Missing' column so it makes a nice simple PR comment for the workflow.
