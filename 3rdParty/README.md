- SD card simulation originally based on Philip Withnall's Brewing Logger: https://gitlab.com/brewing-logger/firmware (see file header for more info about modifications)
- gcovr is a hacked-up version of the official gcovr that excludes the 'Missing' column so it makes a nice simple PR comment for the workflow.
- clang-tidy-to-github is a hacked up version of https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/clang-tidy-to-junit which outputs github annotation format instead.
