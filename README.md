# MK404 - PRINTER NOT FOUND (formerly MK3SIM)
A project/repo for simulating Einsy (and eventually, other) Prusa (and eventually, other) hardware.

*Summary status:* "Mostly" functional, it runs stock firmware very close to the real thing, and should now be able to boot stock Prusa Marlin build for MK3S. "Mostly" because while the overall system is probably usable for the majority of use cases, some aspects of the hardware are simulated only to the extent necessary to get the system working. For example, the TMC "stallguard" register is minimally implemented, and the microstep count is not.

Remaining To-Dos of note:
- [See open issues...](https://github.com/vintagepc/MK404/issues/)

# Getting Started (Building):

To get stared, clone the MK404 repo. the 3rdParty/simavr folder may be empty, you will need to `cd` into the checkout and run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` from within it to pull down the correct simavr dependency. This should also initialize the `tinyobjloader` and `TCLAP` dependencies.

This is now a `cmake` project and independent of simAVR. You can follow normal cmake procedures, using your favourite IDE (or with cmake-gui). The submodules will be built automatically and taken care of for you.

You will need to use a fairly recent version of GCC/G++ (I use 7.4.0). Older versions from the 4.8 era may not support some of the syntax used. Newer versions (G++ 10) may complain about new warnings that are not present in 7.4. You can set a CMAKE option to disable -Werror in this case.

See [Platforms supported](https://github.com/vintagepc/MK404/wiki/Supported-Operating-Systems) for which external packages you need to install to compile from source.

## Non-Linux platforms and prebuilt binaries:
OSX and Cygwin binaries are built but not actively supported. See [Platforms supported](https://github.com/vintagepc/MK404/wiki/Supported-Operating-Systems) for more information on building or running on these operating systems, as well as required packages.

#### Tips:
By default, the flash and EEPROM will be blank on first launch or if you delete the associated .bin files.
You will need to choose and load a firmware file (.afx, .hex) at least once with `-f` or by flashing it from the bootloader `-b` with serial (`-s`) enabled.

You can make an SD card image and copy files to it using `mcopy`, or by placing them in the SDCard folder and running the appropriate step in the makefile.
